# Statistic-Analysis
I conducted a detailed statistical analysis of various optimization algorithms tested on 30 functions with varying dimensionalities (10D, 30D, 50D, 100D). The project involved calculating key performance metrics such as the mean error and standard deviation to evaluate algorithm efficiency.

To rigorously compare the algorithms, I applied non-parametric statistical tests:

Pairwise comparisons using the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test.
A control method using the Friedman Test for overall differences.
Post-hoc tests to adjust for multiple comparisons using procedures like Bonferroni-Dunn, Holm, Holland, Hochberg, and Hommel
